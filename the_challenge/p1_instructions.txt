## P2 Instructions, v1.1 ##

All right, you've found the island, you're getting close. Unfortunately for
you, the robot that usually does the pathfinding was damaged in his last
mission and is currently inoperable. A new interface will get him up and
running though!

As this is your operation, you'll be able to design the Robot class and 
furnish it with whatever methods you see fit- the only requirement is that 
there is at least one class in your program, and it is called Robot.

The island is incredibly large and the robot will start in the very center (so
don't worry about hitting the ocean). The starting location will be 
considered (0,0) and the initial direction will be N(orth). If the robot moved 
one space forward, he would be at 0 1 N. If he then rotated once C, he would be 
at 0 1 NE. The robot will accept a series of instructions and then report its
coordinates and direction once it has stopped moving (input has ended). 

## INPUT ## 
The robot will accept a single line of input, a string consisting of a series
of letters: 

* C: The robot should rotate 45 degrees clockwise
* A: The robot should rotate 45 degrees anti-clockwise
* S: The robot should take a step forward in whatever direction it's facing

formatted in an unseparated, uppercase string.

## OUTPUT ##
Once it has no more input to process, the robot will report its x/y 
coordinates and the direction it was facing, separated by spaces. Direction is
formatted as 1 or 2 uppercase letters and is one of the 8 cardinal directions
(N, NW, W, SW, etc). 

## EXAMPLE ##

## Input:
SSCSSASCSSSASSCCC

## Output:
5 10 SE

Since the robot starts in the middle, he can end up in negative coordinates.
