## RIQuest instructions, v1.3 ##

Welcome to RIQuest, agent. The situation is a dire one- one of our top 
operatives collected some vital intel, but they weren't able to relay it back 
to HQ before they were captured. In the interest of secrecy, this information 
is stored on an encoded disk hidden somewhere in the Galapagos Islands. 

Pack your bags agent, we're about to get tropical.

## TASKS ##
The first task is to pinpoint the island where the disk is hidden. Once there, 
you'll need to develop a way to process the map. We've provided a robot for the
task, but its circuits are fried. Then, once you have the disk, you'll have to 
implement the decoding algorithm yourself. 

## RESOURCES ##
For each of the 3 tasks, there are 3 files:
    pN_instructions.txt:
        The briefing for that particular challenge. This will include specific
        quirks and the details of the mission.
    pN_test.txt:
        Even the most prepared agents need a little sanity check once in a
        while- this is a small test designed to verify your solution meets the
        minimum challenge requirements. It's suggested that you write more
        stringent ones before your final submit.
    pN_puzzle.txt:
        Your actual task.

Other IMPORTANT specifications:
    1. You can use most languages. Check riquest.herokuapp.com/langs for
        exactly which are fair game. C#, Java, and Scala require certain
        classnames, so double check there that you're doing it right.
    2. Use the same language for all 3 challenges.
    3. Code quality matters! Don't gold plate it, but leave us some comments.
    4. All program input should come from stdin at runtime.
    5. Print nothing besides the single answer as specified in the spec. The
        answer should end with a newline character. This includes not writing
        your own error messages.
    6. You may assume input is well formatted and present.
    7. We will test your code with other test cases, so make sure it fits the
        spec and you test it yourself. Think about corner cases.
    8. Read all instructions and follow them carefully!


You're on your own now. Trust no one, and good luck.
