## P2 Instructions, v1.1 ##

Well done, you've reached the disk! Now all that remains is to deal with that 
pesky encoding algorithm. In the interest of security, the cipher they chose
can't be solved without knowing the key used to encode it. The cipher 
is is a Mono-Alphabetic Cipher, the cooler older brother of the more well known
Ceaser Cipher. 

Instead of shifting the message by the alphabet in order, a secret key is 
chosen and the message is instead shifted by following these steps:

Let's say our key is "PALO ALTO".
1. Append to the key a space, followed by the reverse English alphabet.
    ("PALO ALTO ZYXWVUTSRQPONMLKJIHGFEDCBA")
2. Remove duplicate characters (keeping only the first instance of each)
    ("PALO TZYXWVUSRQNMKJIHGFEDCB")
3. This is our cipher alphabet for a Ceasar Cipher. So when encoding, A->P, 
B->A, etc. For this task, you're decoding a message, so that mapping is 
reversed.
    ("ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ ")
    ("PALO TZYXWVUSRQNMKJIHGFEDCB")

All letters in both the key and the alphabet are upper case. There are no 
numbers or punctuation. Also, be careful with trailing spaces!

## BUILDING THE KEY ## 
If you've completed both the 1st and 2nd tasks, this is where you'll use those 
answers. 

## Answer from Task 1: 
    Repeatedly sum the digits of the number until only a single digit remains.
    The key begins with that letter of the English alphabet.
        ex: 78 -> 15 -> 6 -> F

## Answer from Task 2:
    Cast the absolute value of each of the two numbers to a letter in the 
    English alphabet. The letter is already a letter (or letters).
        ex: 4 -8 NE -> 4 8 NE -> D H NE

## Combine them:
    Therefore, the key in the example would be FDHNE.

You should hardcode the key in your program, but generate the cipher alphabet
programatically. Again, the ONLY input is the cipher text.

## INPUT ##
The program will take an uppercase message on a single line. You won't need to 
edit or sanitize input in any way.

## OUTPUT ##
The program will the output the same message, decoded. 

## EXAMPLE ##
(using key 'FDHNE')
## Input: 
    XAIFSLALRAIROVAFLAOEUFLEXP
## Output:
    I WANT TO WORK AT RELATEIQ

This is it. Dare to be great.
