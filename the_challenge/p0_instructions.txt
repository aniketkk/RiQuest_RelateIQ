## P0 Instructions, v1.2 ##

We've got a map! Luckily, it shows us all of the islands in the archipelago.
Less luckily, it doesn't actually indicate which island the disk is hidden on.
We're not without hope though- all you need to do is find the average size of 
all the islands and our ops team will handle the rest.

## INPUT ##

The map will be read in from standard input (as if a user was typing it) at 
runtime. It will have the following format:

2
10
01

Where the first line is the dimensions of the archipelago (which happens to
be perfectly square) and the rest of the lines represent oceans and islands
(0 and 1 respectively). Islands can touch vertically and horizontally, but not
diagonally. The previous example consists of two islands, each with area 1. 

## OUTPUT ## 

Your only program output should be to write the average island size (as an int)
to stdoud (and without any accompanying text. Really. Just the int).

## EXAMPLE ##

## Input:
6
110101
000101
100111
011001
110100
100010

## Output:
3
